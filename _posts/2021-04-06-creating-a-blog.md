## brief

I work with a lot of differnet tech and I read alot of blogs, today I decided I want to write my own blog, so this is my first post showing very quickly the process I went through.

## method

### Whats in a name?

So, what do you call the blog?? This has got to be one of the most important decissions, right? So where to start....well I searched for how to name a blog and ended up at <https://www.name-generator.org.uk>. So I filled in the details and had a look at what comes out.

I'm not going to go through all the choices, but here are my top ones:

- Forbidden Compute
  - Hmmmm really not sure.
- On the Code
  - Well I do code a bit...
- Compute Power Corrupts Absolutely
  - It really does.
- Middle of the Code
  - Again I do code, but I'm not a coder per say.
- The Brown Post
  - It is part of my name and I will be posting....but sounds all wrong.
- Computing Addict
  - I really do like computng.
- Code Compute Learn
  - I really like this, I do code, I do compute and I do learn..alot.

I think I'm really quite taken with `Code|Compute|Learn`, sums up what the blog will be about for me, I'll have to thank the maker of the name-generator website.

### Where to host?

Normally a tricky one, but I use GitHub quite a bit and we host an internal jekyll site at work, so for me using GitHub pages makes sense for the time being.

I started here <https://pages.github.com/> and I used the set of articles on GitHubs help pages <https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll>.

## conclusion

In realality I havent just decided to write a blog, I have been contemplating it for some time. But now that its coming together and my first post is written, I'm excited about the content I will be able to produce.

I know this post doesnt go into any great detail about how to get the blog up and running. Maybe I can do a second post with more detailed steps....

And yes I also know I have written this like a school science project...but thats what works for me.
