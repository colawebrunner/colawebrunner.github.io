## brief

I work with a lot of differnet tech and I read alot of blogs, today I decided I want to write my own blog, so this is how it went.

## method

### Whats in a name?

So what do you call the blog?? This has got to be 1 of the most important decissions, right? So where to start....

goto https://www.name-generator.org.uk, fill in the details and have a look at what comes out.

I'm not going to go through all the choices, but here are my top ones:

- Forbidden Compute
  - Hmmmm really not sure
- On the Code
  - Well I do code a bit...
- Compute Power Corrupts Absolutely
  - It really does
- Middle of the Code
  - Again I do code, but I'm not a coder per say
- The Brown Post
  - It is part of my name and I will be posting....but does sound toilety
- Computing Addict
  - I really do like computng
- Code Compute Learn
  - I really like this, I do code, I do compute and I do learn..alot.

I think I'm really quite taken with `Code|Compute|Learn`, sums up what the blog will be about for me, I'll have to thank the maker of the name-generator website.

### Where to host?

Normally a tricky one, but I use GitHub quite a bit and we host an internal jekyll site at work, so for me using GitHub pages makes sense for the time being.
